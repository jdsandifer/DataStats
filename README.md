# DataStats
A solution to a great interview problem

This was a problem given to me as part of an interview process. I was also given 
the challenge to complete it using a programming language I had not previously used. 
I imagine it will work great to help the hiring manager and the team see if I will 
be a good fit, but it was also a great way for me to quickly learn the basics of C# 
and Visual Studio. I plan to use it again the next time I go to learn a new language.
