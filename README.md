A solution to a great interview problem

This was a problem given to me as part of an interview process. I was also given 
the challenge to complete it using a programming language I had not previously used. 
I imagine it will work great to help the hiring manager and the team see if I will 
be a good fit, but it also was a great way for me to quickly learn the basics of C#. 
I plan to us it again the next time I go to learn a new language.
