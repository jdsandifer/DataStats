# DataStats
A solution to a great coding problem

This was a problem given to me as part of a coding challenge. I was also given 
the challenge to complete it using a programming language I had not previously used. 
It was a great way for me to quickly learn the basics of C# and Visual Studio and 
test my general skills as a software developer. I plan to use it or something like it 
again the next time I go to learn a new language.
